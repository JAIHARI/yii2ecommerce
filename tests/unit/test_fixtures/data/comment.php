A successor to last year\'s identically named model, the late-2017 version of the UX330UA upgrades the processor to a zippy Intel 8th-Gen Core i5 CPU while keeping everything else the same. Unfortunately, the added performance means 1.5 hours less battery life. But with its colorful screen, sweet audio and 2.7-pound chassis, the ZenBook UX330UA is still a great choice for anyone who needs a lightweight Ultrabook at an affordable price.',
